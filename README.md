First deliverable, Lab 1 of Interactive Systems

This is the list of improvements that I have made over the version obtained through the tutorial:
  -  Added diferent and new materials to the elements.
  -  Added levitation effect to the pick ups (up and down movement).
  -  Added scouring force to the ball (To prevent infinite slippage).
  -  Added 9 additional pick ups.
  -  Added the ability to jump (with the "Space" key).
