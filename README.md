First deliverable, Lab 1 of Interactive Systems<br />

This is the **list of improvements** that I have made over the version obtained through the tutorial:<br />
  -  Added **diferent and new materials** to the elements.<br />
  -  Added **levitation effect** to the pick ups (up and down movement).<br />
  -  Added **scouring force** to the ball (To prevent infinite slippage).<br />
  -  Added **9 additional pick ups**.<br />
  -  Added the **ability to jump** (with the "Space" key).<br />
